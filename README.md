## 🎮 About The Game

`IDLE DEV` is an idle/incremental game inspired by the classic *NGU Idle*, but with a theme 100% focused on the programming universe and the life of a developer.

Start as an noob and train your *skills* (like `Attack` and `Defence`), fight *bosses*, earn *gold*, and watch your numbers go up to infinity!

## ✨ Planned Features

Based on the original diagram, the game plans to include:

* **🏋️ Training:** Train your basic stats (Attack, Defence, etc.) using Energy.
* **👹 Fight Boss:** Battle bosses to earn XP, Gold, and Items.
* **🗺️ Adventure:** An AFK game mode to automatically farm items and gold.
* **⛏️ Miners:** Buy bitcoin miners to passively generate gold.
* **🎓 Online Course:** Train "knowledge" stats like `attack` and `defence`.
* **... and much more!** (Pit, Sr. Training, Sass, Virtual Box, etc.)

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **[Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/):** The main reactive framework.
* **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** High-performance build tool for development and build.
